# Typescript Level Editor

This typescript experiment implements drag and drop functionality with DOM elements.

- Create a Mario level by dragging game elements onto the level
- Hold the alt key to duplicate elements that are already in the level
- Works with touch and mouse events
- Snaps items into grid or allows freefrom dragging
- All elements inherit from a DOM class so they can be drawn in the DOM
- Uses CSS transform for animation and drawing
- Uses a cool little hand cursor
